# Meetup Demo Project
## Learning how to commit and deploy a NextJS project
In this project I worked with __MongoDB__ (to create the _database_), **Vercel** (to *deploy*).

And I also learned how to commit, push and pull using:
1. **Git**
2. **GitHub**
3. **Terminal**

Steps:
- [ ] Create the GitHub account
- [ ] Install Git
- [ ] Create a Vercel account
- [ ] Connect GitHub with Vercel
- [ ] Import Github Repo on Vercel
- [ ] Deploy Project
